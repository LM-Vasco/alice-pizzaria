# ALICE'S PIZZARIA


## Description


This is my first project for the Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp.

You are the new cook for Alice's Pizzaria and you have to make some delicious pizzas!


## Instructions


This is the game screen:

At the middle, you can see the available ingredients:

After 3 seconds they will be hidden, so make sure you memorize their positions!

At the left of the screen you have a cutting board where the ingredients you have to use will be:

You have to go back to the now hidden available ingredients and click where you think the right ones are:

If you click on the wrong one, you lose one live.

After you've placed all the ingredients, click the *COOK* button:

As you make more pizzas, the amount of available ingredients and ingredients to use will increase:

The game ends when you lose all your 3 lives.

### Have fun!
